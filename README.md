# Alien Isolation Cutscene Reconstructor

Test project to re-create deleted cutscenes from Alien Isolation. If you're unaware, the game underwent a huge story rewrite around a year before release, where lots of content was reworked and/or scrapped. There are animations for 20 unused cutscenes in the final game files.

This research tool reads the game's animation string database, pulls out all the character animations for a [given cutscene](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Alien:_Isolation_cutscenes), and then attempts to create a composite that plays them all back in sequence with the characters involved.

Unfortunately, the 3rd person Ripley model didn't ship in any map, so any cutscenes you play will have to be without Ripley, unless someome mods her model in from [Aliens vs. Pinball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646670/Pinball_FX3__Aliens_vs_Pinball/), which is the only public source for model AFAIK.

There are also some other missing characters, such as the cat which would've made an appearance in cutscene 6.
